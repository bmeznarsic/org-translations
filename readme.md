elementaryos.org Translations
=============================

DEPRECATED! This repository will not be used anymore. Please don't Translate it anymore.

This repository contains all translation strings for the elementaryos.org website.


## Translation guidelines

* All translations need to start with the English translation.  
  It is the base and will always be used as a fallback for missing translations.
* Some translation strings contain ```%s``` or ```%d```. These will be replaced with a string or a number before being placed on the web page.  
  The content of the ```%s``` or ```%d``` will be mentioned in a comment in the translation file.
* **elementary os** is always spelled with a lowercase e, even if it's at the start of a sentence.
* One commit for new languages. Only use multiple when it makes sense.
* Only one language per pull request.
* index.html doesn't need to be translated.
